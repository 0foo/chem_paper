Another emerging toxin of interst is Microplastics. Much of the following is current theory as this is a emerging environmental pollutant with active ongoing research.

It's difficult to overestimate the vastness of the different types of plastic polymers. Their molecular form has differing effects on their molecular weight, strength, crystal-
linity, weatherability, and fragmentation as well as densities. Also to be considered is any UV resistant additives or other additives in the process. Accordingly, the fate, behavior and ecological impact of their generated MPs in the environment will also likely differ. [1]

Another thing that is difficult overestimate is how widely spread microplastics are throughout the world.

Because of the vast number of types of microplastics and how vast the ecosystems of the world that microplastics are found I'm simply focusing on the environmental chemistry of MP's in a beach and marine environment in this paper.

### Plastic chemistry
The defining characteristic of a plastic substance is essentially consting of polymerized chains of functional groups that repeat up to many thousands of times. 
These functional groups can widely vary and the polymeric chains can be single or branched.
The differenct polymer functional groups give the plastic different characteristics.
For example, Amide polymers allow hydrogen bonds to form between the polymer chains which improves chains packing together and makes the resulting substance durable and strong like Nylon. Whereas a silicon atom in the polymer gives the resulting plastic product extremely good flexibility and heat resistance and non-polar methyl groups make it hydrophic which gives it great uses in thigs like water resistant outdoor products.
When it comes to polymeric branching, short chain branching disrupts inter-chain packing which provides more flexibility and lower density which is good for plastic that can be rolloed into soft sheets like LDPE. Long chain branching improves melt strength during processing: like in foams and films. Non-branching polymers allows the chains pack closer together, which gives the resulting plastic high density and strength.
The global production of plastic resins in recent years is about 300 MMT annually.[11]


### Major categories of plastics are:

Polyolefins
Backbone: carbon–carbon only (no heteroatoms).
Examples: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS).
Use: Grocery bags, soda bottles (HDPE, LDPE, PP), Styrofoam cups (PS).

Acrylics
Backbone: carbon–carbon, but functional side groups (–CN, –COOR).
Examples: PMMA (Plexiglas), PAN (polyacrylonitrile).
Use: Plexiglas windows (PMMA), acrylic sweaters (polyacrylonitrile fibers).

Polyesters
Backbone: repeating ester linkages (–CO–O–).
Examples: PET, PBT, alkyd resins.
Use: Clothing fabric, PET drink bottles, food containers.

Polyamides
Backbone: repeating amide linkages (–CO–NH–).
Examples: Nylon-6,6, Nylon-6, aramids (Kevlar).
Use: Nylon stockings, ropes, fishing nets, carpets.

Polyurethanes
Backbone: repeating urethane linkages (–NH–CO–O–).
Examples: foams, elastomers, coatings.
Use: Foam cushions, insulation, coatings, shoe soles.

Silicones
Backbone: siloxane chain (–Si–O–Si–).
Examples: PDMS, silicone elastomers.
Use: Bakeware, sealants, medical implants, lubricants.

Halogenated plastics
Backbone: carbon–carbon with halogen substituents.
Examples: PVC (–CH₂–CHCl–), PTFE (–CF₂–CF₂–).
Use: PVC pipes, vinyl flooring, PTFE non-stick cookware.



### Microplastics

* Rate by size
large-sized plastics (>25 mm), medium-sized plastics (5–25 mm), MPs (1 µm–5 mm), and nano plastics (inferior to 1 µm),

* Primary and Secondary

Primary microplastics include production pellets/pow-
ders and engineered plastic microbeads, used in cos-
metic formulations, cleaning products and for industrial
abrasives. 
Purposefully industrially manufactured as plastic fibers or particles in the micron size range and is used to manufacture products such as facial cleansers, cosmetics, or airborne media and they have mainly been discharged into the environment via wastewater stations 

In contrast, secondary microplastics come from larger
plastic items that are degraded and consequently frag-
mented, mostly due to weathering degradation, into
microplastic particles.
The latter results from plastics of larger plastic sizes that are broken down from various plastic products through degradation (the physical action of sunlight and waves)

With the primary MPs, production volumes Barnes et al. (2009) are tractable and their use is beginning to be regulated (Rochman et al., 2015b). But, far more abundant in the marine environment are the secondary MPs [11]

Conceivably, the inability of plastic particles to completely or gradually disintegrate has resulted in their ubiquitous presence in the marine environment, as described above, and even in mountains, caves, deserts, and canyons on the mainland


### Which Plastics contribute most to secondary microplastics

Biggest microplastic contributors overall primarily due to volume produced:

1. Polyolefins (PE, PP, PS) → 
    * packaging, disposable goods, foams
    * Enormous global tonnage + high fragmentation rates (packaging, foams)
    * Polystyrene foams (like Styrofoam) are notorious for creating huge numbers of small beads.
    * Surface water sampling  as well as beach sampling generally finds PE and PP to be the dominant MPs often with some expanded PS [11]
    * PE and PP represent 30, and 27% of the global manu-facture of resin (in 2015) and a majority of their compounded products even with additives and fillers, still float in seawater. 
    * The amount of time for a complete degradation of inert plastic polymers such as PE or PP in the marine environment is roughly estimated to several hundreds of years and this degradation is probably the results of several complex processes with various kinetics (Barnes et al., 2009; Gewert et al., 2015).

2. Polyesters 
    * Very high use in textiles & bottles
    * especially textiles
    * Fibers shed and sink or stay suspended; widely detected in sediments and biota
    * Laundry effluent (microfibers), bottle/film fragments
    * Synthetic textiles shed microfibers during laundering, which go straight into waterways.

3. Polyamides (nylon) 
    * Large textile/industrial use; tough fibers persist once released.
    * Microfibers resist breakage; notable in marine settings (gear losses).



### Important note

Much of the following is current theory as this is a emerging environmental pollutant.

It's difficult to overestimate the vastness of the different types of plastic polymers. Their molecular form has differing effects on their molecular weight, strength, crystal-
linity, weatherability, and fragmentation as well as densities. Also to be considered is any UV resistant additives or other additives in the process. Accordingly, the fate, behavior and ecological impact
of their MPs in the marine environment will also likely differ. [11]



### Microplastics in the beach and photic environment
In a beach or photic environment, exposure to solar UVR is one significant mech- anism that results in rapid environmental degradation of polymers. Solar radiation initiates autocatalytic thermal oxidation that is responsible for the degradation process. [11]

Photo-oxidative degradation of polymers is a well researched process involving chromophoric groups which absorb UV light, get excitied, lose an H and then react with oxygen to form chain scission radicals and peroxy radicals, these new radicals then chain react to cycle this process with the continued addition of UV light. This results in the breakdown and crosslinking of the polymer chains and creation of numerous new oxygyn functional groups on the polymer backbone such as aldehydes, ketones, carbonyls, etc. [12]  This also increases the crystalinity of the polymer in early degradation as the more disordered chaotic areas of the polymer are more susceptible to the photooxidative degradation partially because they have more space for oxygen to diffuse. [11]

PE, PP, PS, PET, polycarbonate [PC] and poly(vinyl chloride) [PVC] all
turn yellow to yellow-orange as a result of oxidation.due to the accumulation of degradation products of the polymer itself
(as with PVC, PC and PS) or that from the thermal stabilizers used in
the resin. 

Degradation can be measuered using FTIR. The carbonyl group (C=O) is especially useful when measuring because it gives a strong absorption band (around 1700–1750 cm⁻¹). As weathering progresses, the area under this peak grows, indicating more oxidation. 

The photooxidative degradation primarily happens at the surface layer of the polymer as UV doesn't penetrate deeply. 
This degraded surface layer is then believed to be delaminated through environmental/biotal weathering and swelling effects. In this surface-ablation mode of degradation, a large numbers of daughter fragments with a narrow particle-size distribution are expected as a result of this full weathering process. [11] 

These are typically larger than the 5mm classification for a Microplastic however, it's believable that this cycle could repeat and degrade the smaller particles ad infinitium.

### Microplastics in the marine environment

In aqueous environments, plastic particles made of polyvinyl chlo-
ride, nylon and polyethylene tend to sink more, while polypropylene,
polyethylene and polystyrene plastic materials float or remain sus-
pended. However, the any alteration to their density through processes
like biofouling and adsorption of organic matter can lead to greater
sinking behaviour, which ultimately affects their transportation [13]

While biodegradation (and
even hydrolysis) does occur at sea (Zettler et al., 2013), the reactions
proceed too slowly to result in significant levels of environmental deg-
radation of common plastics under outdoor conditions
Clearly, most conducive to rapid weathering degradation is exposure
in the beach  zone; [11]

No known mechanism exists for degrada-
tion and therefore the removal of plastics that lie beyond the photic
zone suggesting a slow accumulation of plastics in the benthos over
the years.

* Floating MPs typ-
ically accumulate encrusting foulants that have a ballasting effect over a
period of time, increasing their apparent density (Cózar et al., 2014)
causing them to sink in the water column (Ye and Andrady, 1991;
Francesca and Fazey, 2016) ending up in deep water or in the sediment

Floating plastics share the photic zone with plankton and Smaller meso- and nanoplastics form homo-aggregates or co-aggre-
gates with phytoplankton (Long et al., 2015) and sink along with the
biomass with entrapped denser debris. Transparent exopolymer particles: TEP's are acidic, sticky polysaccharides released mainly by phytoplankton and bacteria. Because they carry a negative charge, they are highly effective at entraining dust, detritus, and other suspended matter and can flocculate MP's and cause them to sink.

Floating in surface waters will therefore only be a transient
phase of their fate before they are invariably fouled, entangled with
other debris or grazed, to end up in the benthic sediment.
