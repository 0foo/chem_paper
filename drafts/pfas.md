One of the newer contaminants to emerge as a contaminant in the water supply is a class of chemicals known as PFAS which stands for “per and polyfluoroalkyl substances.” PFAS are comprised of a wide variety of molecules with different physical and chemical properties and molecular weights with perfluoroalkyl moieties as common structural features. The exact definition is somewhat unclear as there's thousands of molecules considered in the PFAS classification and the boundaries are somewhat grey.  The essential idea behind PFAS is the fact they are flourinated carbon alkanes with a structure consisting of a carbon backbone that is fully or mostly saturated with Flourine and either no or some other functional groups.

### PFAS Chemistry
PFAS stands for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances.  
It is a family of thousands of different molecules with the uniting/defining feature being multiple flourines attached to an alkyl chain.
Due to the fact the both Flourine and Hydrogen have a free valence electron they are swappable on carbon backbones.
So chemists can essentially take an alkyl chain and then flourinate it to replace the Hydrogen with Flourine atoms.
For example: a normal fatty acid like octanoic acid (C₇H₁₅COOH) has hydrogens on its carbon chain.
Its PFAS cousin PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid, C₇F₁₅COOH) has all those hydrogens replaced by fluorines.
PFAS are commonly produced through one of two processes— electrochemical fluorination or fluorotelomerization [5]

While both H and F are similar in how they can bond to Carbon with their single valence electron, their differences in molecular form are stark.

1. Strength: 
    * The Fluorine bonds are extremely strong bonds.
        * C–H bonds are relatively weak(approx 410 kJ/mol) and can be broken down by enzymes, sunlight, or microbes.
        * C–F bonds are among the strongest in chemistry(approx 485 kJ/mol), so they resist breakdown and persist in the environment and are called "forever chemicals".
        * The C-F chemical bond in PFAS is among the strongest known, so activating C-F decomposition is only possible at very high temperatures (~1,000–1,250°C or 1,832–2,282°F).

2. Electronegativity: 
    * Fluorine is the most electronegative element in Chemistry so it pulls the electrons strongly towards it from the carbon atom, which gives Flouralkyl molecules several interesting characteristics.
        * There are strong inductive effects from the Flourines along the Carbon backbone and CF3CF2OH(pH approx 6) is much stronger acid than it's ethanol(pH approx 6) cousin.
        * Fl bonds are highly polarized and have weak van der walls forces due to the flourine pulling the electrons so close, which means that in a fluoroalkyl chain a number of these bonds adds up to make the molecule have extremely low surface energy. This makes the molecule exceptionally resistant to interacting with any other molecules whether through dipole, london dispersion, or hydrogen bonds. They are the introverts of molecules. 

These properties create a PFAS molecule that is extremely durable and extremely resistant to chemicals, temperature, sunlight, biodegradation, and repels both oil and water.
This is extremely useful in many products but it's a double edged sword in that the PFAS molecules are also extremely difficult to dispose of when no longer needed.
Studies have reported less-than-complete destruction of PFAS at high operating temperatures (930–980°C or 1,706–1,796°F). [5]

### PFAS Usage 

PFAS products are widely used. In 2020, the United States manufactured or imported approximately 2.9 billion pounds of PFAS. [5]
PFAS molecules are great for giving corrosion resistance and abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, leveling, spreading, and wetting. Examples usage in products includes waterproof fabric such as nylon, yoga pants, carpets, shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, firefighting foam, and the insulation of electrical wire. PFAS are also used by the cosmetic industry in most cosmetics and personal care products, including lipstick, eye liner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, and nail polish(4, 5) For more details on it's usage in the population see this white paper: [4, 5]


### PFAS Lifecycle and routes of exposure
PFAS has several stages to it's lifecycle, of which any can allow PFAS leakage into the environment which can result in biological exposure.[5]

1. Precursor Chemical Production
2. PFAS Production
3. Product Manufacturing
4. Product Use
5. End of life management via a variety of pathways, including composting, landfilling, recycling,and thermal treatment

Notable routes of exposure are:
* Human Contact exposure via food storage, cosmetic, or clothing products
* Constituent, intermediate, or degradation molecules of PFAS that are released into the environment via various pathways including airborne, solid, or liquid molecules.
    * "the use of side-chain fluorinated polymers can result in non-polymeric PFAS degradation products and impurities, which can further degrade. For instance, a non-targeted analysis of molded “compostable” fiber bowls detected 6:2 FTOH, including transformation products of fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids" [5]
    * Researchers have noted when trying to dispose of PFAS additional PFAS molecules are created.
* Landfill leaching 
* Biosolids produced from wastewater treatment process from various detergents used in the treatment process


### PFAS Regulation

Global regulation varies by country. The EU is working on phasing out all non-essential uses of PFAS with enforcment beginning in 2026. [6, 8] France has passed a ban on essentially all PFAS in many consumer products with enforcement starting in 2026 and all textiles in 2030. [7] The USA already has enforcement in play for 6 PFAS molecules. 

"On April 10, 2024, EPA announced the final NPDWR for six PFAS. They established legally enforceable levels, called Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), for six PFAS in drinking water: PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid), PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid), PFNA (perfluorononanoic acid), and HFPO-DA (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, also known as GenX) as contaminants with individual MCLs(Maximum Contaminant Level), and PFAS mixtures containing at least two or more of PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonic acid), PFNA (perfluorononanoic acid), HFPO-DA (hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid), and PFBS (perfluorobutanesulfonic acid) using a Hazard Index MCL to account for the combined and co-occurring levels of these PFAS in drinking water. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also finalized health-based, non-enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) for these PFAS" [3,5]

Out of thousands of molecules only 6 in the USA have been regulated, so there's still many more PFAS molecules that remain unstudied and unregulated.  The EU laws allow sweeping regulations however in the US each molecule must be proven to be harmful before restricting it by the Toxic Substance Control Act. In the TSCA Section 6, the statute requires EPA to determine whether “a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk”, not a CLASS of substances. That framing has historically forced EPA to focus on individual molecules unless it can argue they are the same “substance.” [9, 10]

### PFAS Alternatives

Research is ongoing for PFAS alternatives. Several classes of chemicals are being studied for PFAS substitutes. These include silicones and siloxanes for coatings and packaging, sulfosuccinates and other anionic surfactants for wetting properties, and nonionic surfactants like acetylenic diols for paints and varnishes. More novel approaches include branched polymers, hydrocarbon-based surfactants for cleaning agents, and biologically derived surfactants such as rhamnolipids. Other materials such as graphene and certain ceramics (e.g., boron nitride, titanium dioxide) are also under investigation. Each class comes with trade-offs in performance and cost. [5].
