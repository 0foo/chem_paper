    One of the newer contaminants to emerge in the water supply is a class of chemicals known as PFAS, which stands for “per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.” PFAS comprise a wide variety of molecules with different physical and chemical properties and molecular weights, with perfluoroalkyl moieties as common structural features. The exact definition is somewhat unclear, as thousands of molecules fall under the PFAS classification and the boundaries are somewhat grey. The essential idea behind PFAS is that they are fluorinated carbon alkanes with a carbon backbone fully or mostly saturated with fluorine and either no or some other functional groups.

  <h2>PFAS Chemistry</h2>
  <p>
    PFAS stands for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances. It is a family of thousands of different molecules with the defining feature being multiple fluorines attached to an alkyl chain. Because both fluorine and hydrogen can bond to carbon via a single valence electron, they are swappable on carbon backbones. Chemists can essentially take an alkyl chain and fluorinate it, replacing hydrogen with fluorine atoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example: a normal fatty acid such as octanoic acid (C₇H₁₅COOH) has hydrogens on its carbon chain. Its PFAS cousin, PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid, C₇F₁₅COOH), has all those hydrogens replaced by fluorines. PFAS are commonly produced through electrochemical fluorination or fluorotelomerization
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
  </p>

  <p><strong>1. Strength:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>C–H bonds are relatively weak (~410 kJ/mol) and can be broken down by enzymes, sunlight, or microbes.</li>
    <li>C–F bonds are among the strongest in chemistry (~485 kJ/mol), resisting breakdown and persisting in the environment (“forever chemicals”).</li>
    <li>Activating C–F decomposition requires very high temperatures (~1,000–1,250 °C / 1,832–2,282 °F).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. Electronegativity:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fluorine is the most electronegative element, pulling electrons strongly from carbon and giving fluoroalkyl molecules unique characteristics.</li>
    <li>Strong inductive effects: CF₃CF₂OH (pKₐ ≈ 12) is much more acidic than its ethanol cousin (pKₐ ≈ 16).</li>
    <li>C–F bonds are highly polarized with weak van der Waals forces, yielding molecules with very low surface energy. They resist interactions with other molecules (dipole, dispersion, or hydrogen bonding) — the “introverts” of molecules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These properties create PFAS molecules that are extremely durable, resistant to chemicals, temperature, sunlight, and biodegradation, while repelling both oil and water. This durability makes PFAS useful in many products but also extremely difficult to dispose of. Studies report less-than-complete destruction of PFAS even at 930–980 °C (1,706–1,796 °F)

<article id="pfas-usage">
  <h2>PFAS Usage</h2>
  <p>
    PFAS products are widely used. In 2020, the United States manufactured or imported approximately 2.9 billion pounds of PFAS
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    PFAS confer corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, leveling, spreading, and wetting. Product examples include waterproof fabrics (nylon, yoga pants, carpets), shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, firefighting foam, and electrical wire insulation. The cosmetic industry also uses PFAS in most cosmetics and personal care products (lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, nail polish)

<article id="pfas-lifecycle">
  <h2>PFAS Lifecycle and Routes of Exposure</h2>
  <p>
    PFAS have several lifecycle stages, each capable of releasing PFAS into the environment and resulting in biological exposure
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Precursor Chemical Production</li>
    <li>PFAS Production</li>
    <li>Product Manufacturing</li>
    <li>Product Use</li>
    <li>End-of-life management (composting, landfilling, recycling, thermal treatment)</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Notable routes of exposure:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Human contact via food storage, cosmetics, or clothing.</li>
    <li>
      Constituent, intermediate, or degradation molecules released into the environment (airborne, solid, liquid).
      <br>For example, side-chain fluorinated polymers can degrade into non-polymeric PFAS products. A study of molded “compostable” fiber bowls detected 6:2 FTOH and transformation products of fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acids
      <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.

<article id="pfas-regulation">
  <h2>PFAS Regulation</h2>
  <p>
    Global regulation varies. The EU is working to phase out all non-essential PFAS uses, with enforcement beginning in 2026
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>, <a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup>.
    France has banned most PFAS in consumer products starting in 2026, with all textiles included by 2030
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>.
    The USA has enforceable limits for 6 PFAS molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
    On April 10, 2024, EPA announced the final NPDWR for six PFAS. Legally enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) were set for PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (GenX), with a Hazard Index MCL for mixtures of PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA, and PFBS
    <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a>, <a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
    EPA also finalized non-enforceable Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLGs) for these PFAS.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out of thousands of PFAS molecules, only 6 are regulated in the USA. EU law allows sweeping regulation of PFAS classes, but in the US each molecule must be proven harmful before restriction under the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). Section 6 requires EPA to show “unreasonable risk” for each chemical substance, not a class, forcing case-by-case evaluation

        Another emerging toxin of interst is Microplastics. Much of the following is current theory as this
        is a emerging environmental pollutant with active ongoing research.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's difficult to overestimate the vastness of the different types of plastic polymers. Their molecular form has
        differing effects on their molecular weight, strength, crystal-
        linity, weatherability, and fragmentation as well as densities. Also to be considered is any UV resistant
        additives
        or other additives in the process. Accordingly, the fate, behavior and ecological impact of their generated MPs
        in
        the environment will also likely differ. <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing that is difficult overestimate is how widely spread microplastics are throughout the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the vast number of types of microplastics and how vast the ecosystems of the world that microplastics
        exist I'm simply focusing on the environmental chemistry of MP's in a beach and marine environment in this
        paper.

      <h3>Plastic chemistry</h3>

      <p>
        The defining characteristic of a plastic substance is essentially consting of polymerized chains of functional
        groups that repeat up to many thousands of times.
        These functional groups can widely vary and the polymeric chains can be single or branched.
      </p>

      <p>
        The differenct polymer functional groups give the plastic different characteristics.
        For example, Amide polymers allow hydrogen bonds to form between the polymer chains which improves chains
        packing together and makes the resulting substance durable and strong like Nylon.
        Whereas a silicon atom in the polymer gives the resulting plastic product extremely good flexibility and heat
        resistance and non-polar methyl groups make it hydrophic which gives it great uses in thigs like water resistant
        outdoor products.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to polymeric branching, short chain branching disrupts inter-chain packing which provides more
        flexibility and lower density which is good for plastic that can be rolloed into soft sheets like LDPE.
        Long chain branching improves melt strength during processing: like in foams and films.
        Non-branching polymers allows the chains pack closer together, which gives the resulting plastic high density
        and strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        The global production of plastic resins in recent years is about 300 MMT annually.<sup class="cite"><a

      <h3>Microplastics</h3>

      <p><strong>Rate by size.</strong> large-sized plastics (&gt;25 mm), medium-sized plastics (5–25 mm), MPs (1 µm–5
        mm), and nanoplastics (&lt;1 µm).</p>

      <p><strong>Primary and Secondary.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Primary microplastics include production pellets/powders and engineered plastic microbeads used in cosmetic
        formulations, cleaning products, and industrial abrasives.
        Purposefully manufactured as plastic fibers or particles in the micron size range and used to make products such
        as facial cleansers, cosmetics, or airborne media; they have mainly been discharged into the environment via
        wastewater stations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, secondary microplastics come from larger plastic items that are degraded and consequently
        fragmented—mostly due to weathering degradation—into microplastic particles.
        The latter results from plastics of larger sizes that are broken down from various plastic products through
        degradation (the physical action of sunlight and waves).
      </p>
      <p>
        With the primary MPs, production volumes (Barnes et al., 2009) are tractable and their use is beginning to be
        regulated (Rochman et al., 2015b). But far more abundant in the marine environment are the secondary MPs
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceivably, the inability of plastic particles to completely or gradually disintegrate has resulted in their
        ubiquitous presence in the marine environment, and even in mountains, caves, deserts, and canyons on the
        mainland.

      <h3>Which Plastics Contribute Most to Secondary Microplastics</h3>

      <h3>Microplastics in the beach and photic environment</h3>

      <p>
        In a beach or photic environment, exposure to solar UVR is a significant mechanism that results in rapid
        environmental degradation of polymers. Solar radiation initiates autocatalytic thermal oxidation responsible for
        the degradation process
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photo-oxidative degradation of polymers involves chromophoric groups that absorb UV light, become excited, lose
        H, and then react with oxygen to form chain-scission radicals and peroxy radicals. These radicals chain-react
        under continued UV exposure,
        causing further breakdown and crosslinking of polymer chains and creating numerous new oxygen functional groups
        on the backbone (aldehydes, ketones, carbonyls, etc.)
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>.
        Early in degradation, crystallinity often increases because the more disordered regions are more susceptible to
        photo-oxidation and allow greater oxygen diffusion and this leads to more ordered molecules via degradation of the disorder.
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        PE, PP, PS, PET, polycarbonate (PC), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) all turn yellow to yellow-orange as a result
        of oxidation due to degradation products of the polymer itself (as with PVC, PC, PS) or those from thermal
        stabilizers used in the resin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Degradation can be measured using FTIR: the carbonyl group (C=O) gives a strong band around 1700–1750 cm⁻¹; as
        weathering progresses, the area under this peak grows, indicating more oxidation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photo-oxidation primarily affects the surface layer because UV does not penetrate deeply. This degraded surface
        is then believed to delaminate via environmental/biotal weathering and swelling. In this surface-ablation mode,
        large numbers of daughter
        fragments with a narrow particle-size distribution are expected once weathering runs to completion
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These fragments are typically larger than the 5&nbsp;mm microplastic cutoff; however, it is plausible that the
        cycle repeats, degrading smaller particles ad infinitum.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article id="marine-environment">
      <h3>Microplastics in the marine environment</h3>

      <p>
        In aqueous environments, plastic particles made of polyvinyl chloride, nylon, and polyethylene tend to sink
        more, while polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene often float or remain suspended. Alterations to density
        through processes like
        biofouling and adsorption of organic matter can increase sinking, affecting transport
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        While biodegradation (and even hydrolysis) does occur at sea (Zettler et&nbsp;al., 2013), these reactions
        proceed too slowly to produce significant environmental degradation of common plastics under outdoor conditions.
        The beach zone is most conducive
        to rapid weathering degradation
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        No known mechanism exists for degradation—and thus removal—of plastics lying beyond the photic zone, suggesting
        slow accumulation in the benthos over the years.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Floating MPs typically accumulate encrusting foulants that ballast them over time, increasing apparent density
          (Cózar et&nbsp;al., 2014), causing sinking in the water column (Ye &amp; Andrady, 1991; Francesca &amp; Fazey,
          2016) and deposition in deep water or sediments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Smaller meso- and nanoplastics can form homo-aggregates or co-aggregates with phytoplankton (Long et&nbsp;al.,
          2015) and sink with the biomass. Transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs)—acidic, sticky polysaccharides
          released mainly by phytoplankton
          and bacteria—carry negative charge and effectively entrain dust, detritus, and other suspended matter,
          flocculating MPs and promoting sinking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Floating in surface waters is therefore often a transient phase before particles are fouled, entangled with
        other debris, grazed, or otherwise transported to benthic sediment.
