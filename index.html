      <h2>Microplastics</h2>

      <p>
        A newly emerging contaminant of interest is microplastics (MPs). Despite plastic, and by extension
        microplastics, being around for decades, society is now finally being alerted to their contaminant qualities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Microplastics are microscopic (5 mm or less) pieces of plastic that either enter the environment as microplastics or 
        are created as a result of environmental degradation of larger sized plastic sources. It's difficult to overestimate the vastness of
        different types of base plastic polymers that microplastics originate from. There are many variables to tweak to make a new type of plastic
        polymer: functional groups, backbone type, crosslinking, copolymers, additives, fillers, and processing
        parameters all contribute to the formation of a polymer. The polymer’s molecular form then has differing effects
        on its molecular weight, strength, crystallinity, weatherability, fragmentation, density, UV resistance, etc.
        Accordingly, the fates, behaviors, and ecological impacts of their generated MPs in the environment will also
        likely differ
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing that is difficult to overestimate is how widely distributed microplastics, and plastic in general,
        have become throughout the world. According to recent research, some 360 million tons of plastic are generated
        each year across the world and only 7% of this material is recycled, meaning that the bulk ends up in the
        environment
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-16">[16]</a></sup>.
        Plastics are very durable and last a long time. Microplastics are transported in water, air, wind, and rain, and
        can even remain suspended in the atmosphere. There are even studies showing they are transported by earthworms
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-16">[16]</a></sup>.
        Microplastics have been found in soil and snow of remote pristine mountains of the French Pyrenees and in the
        majority of remote locations in the USA, such as national parks and national wilderness regions. They have been
        found in all water systems tested
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-16">[16]</a></sup>, and there is even a large floating garbage patch accumulation of
        plastic in the central Pacific
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-17">[17]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the vast number of types of microplastics and the vast range of ecosystems they inhabit, an
        exhaustive paper would be unfeasible; therefore, this paper is limited to selected topics of interest.

      <h3>Plastic Chemistry</h3>

      <p>
        The defining characteristic of a plastic substance is polymerized chains of functional groups that repeat up to
        many thousands of times. These functional groups can vary widely and the polymeric chains can be linear or
        branched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different polymer functional groups and branching types give plastics different characteristics.<br />
        For example, amide polymers allow hydrogen bonds to form between polymer chains, which improves chain packing
        and makes the resulting substance durable and strong (e.g., nylon). In contrast, including silicon in the
        backbone (silicones) yields excellent flexibility and heat resistance, and attached non-polar methyl groups make
        it hydrophobic which is useful for water-resistant outdoor products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regarding polymeric branching, short-chain branching disrupts interchain packing, providing more flexibility and
        lower density (useful for soft sheets like LDPE). Long-chain branching improves melt strength during processing
        (e.g., foams and films). Non-branching polymers allow the chains to pack closer together, yielding higher
        density and strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        The global production of plastic resins in recent years is about 360+ MMT annually
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.

      <h3>Microplastics Categorization</h3>

      <p><strong>Category by size.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Large-sized plastics (&gt;25 mm)</li>
        <li>Medium-sized plastics (5–25 mm)</li>
        <li>Microplastics (MPs; 1 µm–5 mm)</li>
        <li>Nanoplastics (&lt;1 µm)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Category by origin.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Primary microplastics are those that emerge from the production stage as microplastics. This includes production
        pellets/powders and engineered plastic microbeads used in cosmetic formulations, cleaning products, and
        industrial abrasives. Purposefully manufactured as plastic fibers or particles in the micron size range and used
        to make products such as facial cleansers, cosmetics, or airborne media, they have mainly been discharged into
        the environment via wastewater stations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, secondary microplastics come from larger plastic items that are degraded and consequently
        fragmented—mostly due to weathering—into microplastic particles. Larger plastics are broken down by sunlight,
        waves, and other environmental forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        For primary MPs, production volumes are tractable and their use is beginning to be regulated. However, far more
        abundant in the marine environment are the secondary MPs
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inability of plastic particles to completely or rapidly disintegrate has resulted in their ubiquitous
        presence in the marine environment, and even in mountains, caves, deserts, and canyons on the mainland.

      <h3>Which Plastics Contribute Most to Secondary Microplastics</h3>

      <p><em>Biggest microplastic contributors overall, primarily due to volume produced:</em></p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Polyolefins (PE, PP, PS)</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Packaging, disposable goods, foams</li>
            <li>Enormous global tonnage + high fragmentation rates (packaging, foams)</li>
            <li>Polystyrene foams (e.g., Styrofoam) are notorious for creating huge numbers of small beads.</li>
            <li>
              Surface water and beach sampling generally find PE and PP to dominate MPs, often with some expanded PS
              <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
            </li>
            <li>PE and PP represent ~30% and ~27% of global resin manufacture; many compounded products still

            <li>The time for complete degradation of inert polymers such as PE or PP in the marine environment is

      <h3>Microplastics in the Beach and Photic Environment</h3>

      <p>
        In beach or photic environments, exposure to solar UVR is a significant mechanism that results in rapid
        environmental degradation of polymers. Solar radiation initiates autocatalytic thermal oxidation responsible for
        the degradation process
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photo-oxidative degradation of polymers involves chromophoric groups that absorb UV light, become excited, lose
        H, and then react with oxygen to form chain-scission radicals and peroxy radicals. These radicals chain-react
        under continued UV exposure, causing further breakdown and crosslinking of polymer chains and creating numerous
        new oxygen-containing functional groups on the backbone (aldehydes, ketones, carbonyls, etc.)
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-12">[12]</a></sup>.
        Early in degradation, crystallinity often increases because the more disordered regions are more susceptible to
        photo-oxidation and allow greater oxygen diffusion, which leads to more ordered material as the disorder
        degrades
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        PE, PP, PS, PET, polycarbonate (PC), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) all turn yellow to yellow-orange as a result
        of oxidation due to degradation products of the polymer itself (as with PVC, PC, PS) or those from thermal
        stabilizers used in the resin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Degradation can be measured using FTIR: the carbonyl group (C=O) gives a strong band around 1700–1750 cm⁻¹; as
        weathering progresses, the area under this peak grows, indicating more oxidation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Photo-oxidation primarily affects the surface layer because UV does not penetrate deeply. This degraded surface
        is then believed to delaminate via environmental/biotal weathering and swelling. In this surface-ablation mode,
        large numbers of daughter fragments with a narrow particle-size distribution are expected once weathering runs
        to completion
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        These fragments are typically larger than the 5&nbsp;mm microplastic cutoff; however, it is plausible that the
        cycle repeats, degrading smaller particles ad infinitum.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article id="marine-environment">
      <h3>Microplastics in the Marine Environment</h3>

      <p>
        While biodegradation (and even hydrolysis) does occur at sea, these reactions proceed too slowly to produce
        significant environmental degradation of common plastics under outdoor conditions. The beach zone is most
        conducive to rapid weathering degradation
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-11">[11]</a></sup>.
        No known mechanism exists for degradation, and thus removal, of plastics lying beyond the photic zone,
        suggesting slow accumulation in the benthos over the years.
      </p>

      <p>
        In aqueous environments, plastic particles made of polyvinyl chloride, nylon, and polyethylene tend to sink
        more, while polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene often float or remain suspended. Alterations to density
        through processes like biofouling and adsorption of organic matter can increase sinking, affecting transport
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-13">[13]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Floating MPs typically accumulate encrusting foulants that ballast them over time, increasing apparent density
        and causing sinking in the water column and deposition in deep water or sediments. Smaller meso- and
        nanoplastics can form homo-aggregates or co-aggregates with phytoplankton and sink with the biomass. Transparent
        exopolymer particles (TEPs); acidic, sticky polysaccharides released mainly by phytoplankton and bacteria; carry
        negative charge and effectively entrain dust, detritus, and other suspended matter, flocculating MPs and
        promoting sinking. Floating in surface waters is therefore often a transient phase before particles are fouled,
        entangled with other debris, grazed, or transported to benthic sediment

        Another contaminant to emerge as a substance of concern within the past 10 years is a class of chemicals known

      <h3>PFAS Chemistry</h3>
      <p>
        PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. It is a family of thousands of different molecules with the
        defining feature being multiple fluorines attached to an alkyl chain. Because both fluorine and hydrogen can
        bond to carbon via a single valence electron, they are swappable on carbon backbones. Chemists can take an alkyl
        chain and fluorinate it, replacing hydrogen with fluorine atoms. For example, a normal fatty acid such as
        octanoic acid (C₇H₁₅COOH) has hydrogens on its carbon chain; its PFAS cousin, PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid,
        C₇F₁₅COOH), has all those hydrogens replaced by fluorines. PFAS are commonly produced through electrochemical
        fluorination or fluorotelomerization
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
      </p>

      <p><strong>1. Strength:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>C–H bonds are relatively weak (~410 kJ/mol) and can be broken down by enzymes, sunlight, or microbes.</li>
        <li>C–F bonds are among the strongest in chemistry (~485 kJ/mol), resisting breakdown and persisting in the
          environment (“forever chemicals”).</li>
        <li>Activating C–F decomposition requires very high temperatures (~1,000–1,250 °C / 1,832–2,282 °F).</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>2. Electronegativity:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fluorine is the most electronegative element, pulling electrons strongly from carbon and giving fluoroalkyl
          molecules unique characteristics.</li>
        <li>Strong inductive effects: CF₃CF₂OH (pKₐ ≈ 12) is much more acidic than its ethanol cousin (pKₐ ≈ 16).</li>
        <li>C–F bonds are highly polarized with weak van der Waals forces, yielding molecules with very low surface
          energy. They resist interactions with other molecules (dipole, dispersion, or hydrogen bonding)—the
          “introverts” of molecules.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These properties create PFAS molecules that are extremely durable, resistant to chemicals, temperature,
        sunlight, and biodegradation, while repelling both oil and water. This durability makes PFAS useful in many
        products but also extremely difficult to dispose of. Studies report less-than-complete destruction of PFAS even
        at 930–980 °C (1,706–1,796 °F)

        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        PFAS confer corrosion resistance, abrasion resistance, hydrophobicity, leveling, spreading, and wetting. Product
        examples include waterproof fabrics (nylon, yoga pants, carpets), shampoo, feminine hygiene products, mobile
        phone screens, wall paint, furniture, adhesives, food packaging, firefighting foam, and electrical wire
        insulation. The cosmetic industry also uses PFAS in many cosmetics and personal care products (lipstick,
        eyeliner, mascara, foundation, concealer, lip balm, blush, nail polish)

      <h3>PFAS Lifecycle and Routes of Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        PFAS have several lifecycle stages, each capable of releasing PFAS and resulting in environmental exposure
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Precursor chemical production</li>
        <li>PFAS production</li>
        <li>Product manufacturing</li>
        <li>Product use</li>
        <li>End-of-life management (composting, landfilling, recycling, thermal treatment)</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Notable routes of environmental exposure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Human contact via food storage, cosmetics, or clothing.</li>
        <li>
          Constituent, intermediate, or degradation molecules released into the environment (airborne, solid, liquid).
          For example, side-chain fluorinated polymers can degrade into non-polymeric PFAS products; a study of molded
          “compostable” fiber bowls detected 6:2 FTOH and transformation products of fluorotelomer unsaturated
          carboxylic acids
          <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>.
        </li>
        <li>Additional PFAS molecules may form during disposal attempts.</li>
        <li>Landfill leaching.</li>
        <li>Biosolids from wastewater treatment processes.</li>

      <h3>PFAS Regulation</h3>
      <p>
        Global regulation varies. The EU is working to phase out all non-essential PFAS uses, with enforcement beginning
        in 2026
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a>, <a href="#ref-8">[8]</a></sup>.
        France has banned most PFAS in consumer products starting in 2026, with all textiles included by 2030
        <sup class="cite"><a href="#ref-7">[7]</a></sup>.
        The USA has enforceable limits for 6 PFAS molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of thousands of PFAS molecules, only six are regulated in the USA. EU law allows sweeping regulation of PFAS
        classes, but in the US each molecule must be proven harmful before restriction under the Toxic Substances
        Control Act (TSCA). Section 6 requires EPA to show “unreasonable risk” for each chemical substance, not a class,
        forcing case-by-case evaluation

      <h3>PFAS Alternatives</h3>
      <p>Research continues into PFAS substitutes. Candidate classes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Silicones and siloxanes (coatings, packaging)</li>
        <li>Sulfosuccinates and other anionic surfactants (wetting agents)</li>
        <li>Nonionic surfactants such as acetylenic diols (paints, varnishes)</li>
        <li>Branched polymers</li>
        <li>Hydrocarbon-based surfactants (cleaning agents)</li>
        <li>Biologically derived surfactants (e.g., rhamnolipids)</li>
        <li>Other materials under study: graphene, ceramics (boron nitride, titanium dioxide)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Microplastics and PFAS are two of the most significant emerging contaminants, each highlighting how 
        innovation can outpace science. Both pollutants are examples of the difficulties of managing
        substances designed for high durability but lacking clear end-of-life and disposal pathways. 
        Mitigation strategies must therefore
        prioritize: prevention at the source, better product and waste design, and investment in safer alternatives.
        Continued scientific research and global monitoring and coordinated policy action remain essential. Taken together, the chemistry,
        distribution, and
        persistence of microplastics and PFAS serve as a cautionary lesson: the properties that make materials useful
        can also make them environmental threats.
